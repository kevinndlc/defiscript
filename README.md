<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview

[![DefiScript Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://defiscript.qtradingtheory.com/)

DefiMining is a play-to-earn game based on the WAX blockchain, where you have to mine tokens with virtual rigs, produce electricity and and create components, where each entity is an NFT.

I created DefiScript in order to automate this whole process, so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of the game without spending all their time on it.
